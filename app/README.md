# Run Application

Please see the Python code file `face_detection_openvino.py`, which shows how to load converted models, and start using them.

Running and consuming deep learning models is easy, only thing you should do that the post-processing output vectors as they supposed to be. 

Therefore, when you know the conversion of those layers to meaningful values then you are ready to go. 

Please see the source code for detailed explanation of usage.
